# eCommerce Transactions Analysis

This project aims to analyze eCommerce transaction data to derive insights, build predictive models, and segment customers based on their behaviors. The analysis is structured into several key components, each represented by dedicated notebooks and scripts.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
  - **raw/**: Raw eCommerce transactions dataset files.
  - **processed/**: Processed data files after cleaning and transformations.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for various analyses.
  - **EDA.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis, including visualizations and summary statistics.
  - **Lookalike_Model.ipynb**: Building and evaluating a lookalike model to identify potential customers.
  - **Customer_Segmentation_Clustering.ipynb**: Customer segmentation and clustering analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SaiRamReddySolleti/Ecommerce-data-analysis.git
   cd ecommerce-transactions-analysis
   ```


## Usage Guidelines
